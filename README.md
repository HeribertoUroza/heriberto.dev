### ToDo

    - Need to see if this can be done with css or something else needed.
2. Have the site load the a different image based on the date.
3. Research how the Tie will change color based on the page they are on. 
    - having issues with current svg image, need to try and remake a new one. Also look into "masking" the svg. Could help with goal of changing color.
    - For now, possible options are to leave alone leave alone with black and white tie or depending on the scroll view, change the image.
    - Looking into pseudo elements to change up the background of an image
